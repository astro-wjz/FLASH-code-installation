# FLASH-code-installation
Installation procedure of FLASH code for MHD simulation

All of the software is open source except FLASH4.X, you should go to http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/ to request an account.

This installation guide is espescially for GCC version > 4.8 Redhat centos7, other versions may lead to unsuccessful installation.

My PATH-TO-INSTALL is /home/jzwang/flash/software, and my tar-files store in /home/jzwang/flash/, you can change your path by yourself.
